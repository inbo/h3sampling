# sbsampling: Sequence-Based Spatially Balanced Sampling on the Sphere

[Van Calster, Hans](mailto:hans.vancalster%40inbo.be)[^1]

**keywords**: H3; GRTS; spatially balanced sampling; Sobol sequence

<!-- description: start -->

Implements spatially balanced sampling algorithms on the sphere using
sequence-based randomization. It offers two distinct methodologies:
exact-area continuous sampling from vector geodata utilizing
Owen-scrambled Sobol sequences, and discrete spatial sampling via the H3
global grid system. Both approaches operate natively on spherical
geographic coordinates, eliminating the need for map projections while
ensuring spatially well-distributed survey points.
<!-- description: end -->

The `sbsampling` package implements sequence-based spatially balanced
sampling designs where the input sampling frame is in spherical
coordinates (typically a vector polygon or multi-polygon). The functions
either directly sample from the continuous spatial domain or leverage
the [H3](https://h3geo.org/) discrete global grid system for indexing
spatial data into a hexagonal grid. For the latter, the package provides
spatially balanced sampling via an adaptation of the Generalized Random
Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) algorithm. For the former, two
implementations are provided. One, is a modification of the balanced
acceptance sampling (BAS) algorithm (Robertson) whereby points are drawn
from a 2-D Owen-scrambled Sobol sequence and accepted when inside the
sampling frame. Its domain of applicability should be restricted to
relatively compact spatial domains. For non-compact spatial domains, we
provide an implementation of the GRTS algorithm based on the Sobol
sequence that does not need a discretization step.

All algorithms implemented in the package are sequence-based, meaning
that they are especially suitable for so-called master samples. For a
given given random seed (and H3 resolution in case H3 discretization),
all sampling units are deterministically sorted such that consecutively
ordered sampling units are spatially balanced samples for a given area
on earth.

The implementation is written in [`Rust`](https://rust-lang.org/) with
the aid of `rextendr`. The package is developed with the aid of large
language models Google Gemini pro and Antropic Claude Sonnet 4.6. The
former for brainstorming and code writing, the latter for a final critic
and improvements on the code base. R code is kept to a bare minimum and
the package has zero R dependencies. All algorithms are thoroughly
tested, both with unit testing and simulations. The implementation is
lightweight, cross-platform, fast and memory friendly.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git("https://github.com/inbo/sbsampling")
```

## Example

For an example, we extract Ashe county from the North Carolina state
dataset that ships with the `sf` package. We draw a spatially balanced
sample with the aid of `h3_grts()` at resolution 7 of the [H3
resolutions](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/) system. This
corresponds to hexagonal areas of approximately 5.16 km². The `h3o`
package can be used to, among other things, obtain the hexagon centroid
or vertices.

``` r
library(sbsampling)
nc_path <- system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf")
ashe <- sf::st_read(
  nc_path,
  quiet = TRUE,
  query = "SELECT * FROM nc WHERE NAME='Ashe'"
)
ashe_wkb <- ashe |>
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  sf::st_as_binary()
ashe_wkb <- ashe_wkb[[1]]
  
h3_sample <- h3_grts(
  wkb = ashe_wkb,
  n = 20,
  resolution = 7,
  containment = "centroid",
  seed = 123,
  area_correction = FALSE
)
h3_sample$geom_points <- h3_sample$cell |>
  h3o::h3_from_strings() |>
  h3o::h3_to_points()
h3_sample$geom_hexagons <- h3_sample$cell |>
  h3o::h3_from_strings() |> 
  h3o::h3_to_vertexes() |>
  sf::st_cast("POLYGON")
```

We can visualise the selected spatially balanced sample and the H3
cells:

``` r
ashe_cells <- h3o::sfc_to_cells(
  ashe$`_ogr_geometry_`,
  resolution = 7,
  containment = "centroid"
)
ashe_hexagons <- h3o::h3_to_vertexes(ashe_cells[[1]]) |>
  sf::st_cast("POLYGON")
plot(ashe$`_ogr_geometry_`)
plot(ashe_hexagons, add = TRUE)
plot(h3_sample$geom_hexagons, col = "lightgreen", add = TRUE)
plot(h3_sample$geom_points, add = TRUE, cex = 0.3)
```
